# Word-Guessing-Game

Word guessing game using JavaScript and Web APIs

## ✍️ User Story

- As a user, I want to start the game by clicking on a button.

- As a user, I want to try and guess a word by filling in a number of blanks that match the number of letters in that word.

- As a user, I want the game to be timed.

- As a user, I want to win the game when I have guessed all the letters in the word.

- As a user, I want to lose the game when the timer runs out before I have guessed all the letters.

- As a user, I want to see my total wins and losses on the screen.

### 🤝 Acceptance Criteria

  Then: the user's guess is captured as a key event.
